        Most AI initiatives don’t fail because the model is weak. They fail because production has rules that demos ignore.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a demo, the input is clean, the prompt is tuned, latency is forgiven, and the outcome doesn’t need a receipt.
        In production, the input is messy, workflows are brittle, and the business needs to know what happened, why it happened,
        and how to undo it if it goes sideways.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gap shows up the moment you try to connect the model to a real system. Suddenly you need contracts on inputs,
        guardrails on outputs, and an operating model for when the model is uncertain. That’s not “extra work.” That’s the work.
      </p>

      <p>
        A production AI feature is a system composed of layers: data shaping, retrieval, policy, evaluation, observability,
        approvals, and audit trails. The model is a component, not the product.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want AI to survive real workflows, build for reliability under pressure: explicit fallbacks, human override paths,
        strict boundaries on what the system can do, and instrumentation that makes behavior explainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stop asking “Is the model good enough?” Start asking “Can this survive real workflows?”
      </p>

      <p class="text-white">
        Production AI is not about intelligence. It’s about reliability you can stand behind.
